Trello's REST principles:

1. **Layered:** can be assumed that it has a client-server layered architecture for modularity properties. 

2. **Client cache:** the web browser uses cookies for login.

3. **Client-server:** the web application sends requests to server.

4. **Stateless:** the request sent is self-contained and includes the information so that the server does not have to save information about user states.

5. **Uniform interface**: requests are using URL and responses uses a JSON.
